# Solution
This folder contains the solutions to all the tasks.

One important note is that you would not be able to run the scripts because they use different variables and workspace. If you need to take a peek, I would recommend copy-paste to your own code and change the variable to fit your workspace and dataset.


## Note-to-self
Need to be inside this folder to run the code. Except `3_upload_dataset.py` it contains path outside of the solution folder (run from local folder).
